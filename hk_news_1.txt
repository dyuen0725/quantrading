Secretary for Security John Lee today said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is mulling over the need to prepare for a third chartered flight to evacuate Hong Kong residents aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Speaking to the media at the Legislative Council this morning, Mr Lee said the Immigration Department has contacted all 352 Hong Kong residents on the cruise ship and more than 200 have indicated that they will take the chartered flights arranged by the Hong Kong SAR Government to return home. He noted that Japanese authorities will start allowing passengers to disembark today, once they have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. He explained that about 20 Hong Kong passengers should have tested negative for the virus so far.
