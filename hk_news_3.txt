Chief Executive Carrie Lam urged Hong Kong residents aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan to return home via chartered flights arranged by the Government. Addressing the media before todayâ€™s Executive Council meeting, Mrs Lam said the Immigration Department has deployed staff to communicate with the 300-some Hong Kong residents on the ship. She said there are still 10 outstanding residents and that the department will continue to reach out to them. For Hong Kong passengers who do not have a means of contact, the Government will try to approach them through the cruise company. Since a number of Hong Kong residents have expressed reservations about taking the chartered flights, Mrs Lam said the Government will send each of the Hong Kong people on the cruise ship a letter to explain the arrangment and the consequences of not taking the chartered flights.
