This a strategy development project on Bitcoin futures based on NLP in Twitter data. It is a research project conducted by my schoolmates and me.  
The main idea is to quantify the market sentiment of Bitcoin using Twitter text data by its API. If there is positive sentiment, we long Bitcoin futures and we do the opposite if there is negative sentiment. We backtest this logic in the historical data, then optimizing the parameter to maximize risk adjusted return. After that, walk forward test is done to ensure the robustness of the strategy. 
Although some strategy logic did not provide satisfactory risk adjsuted return, the strategy development process is still in progress to aim at better results.
